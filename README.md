##The Dam
The W.A.C Bennett Dam is a hydroelectric dam on the Peace River in northern British Columbia, Canada. The dam is one of the largest earth-filled dams in the world, standing at 186 metres tall. Construction of the dam began in 1963 and was completed in 1983. The total cost of the project was $750 million. The dam has the capacity to generate more than 13,000 GWh annually, supplying at times approximately 1.6 million inhabitants. 
##Controversy
The construction of the dam was not without controversy. To construct the dam, 350,000 acres of forest were flooded, resulting in a loss of biodiversity and wildlife. Additionally, 40 to 50 First Nations residents who lived in the valley had to be relocated after the flooding.
